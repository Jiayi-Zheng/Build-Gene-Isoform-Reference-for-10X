# Build-Gene-Isoform-Reference-for-10X
Script for modifying 10X standard reference gtf, to view each individual transcript in a gene as individual genes, thereby enable isoform detection using 10X alignment pipeline. However, the limitation of 10X short-read sequencing should be noted when interpreting the result.
